                                <li>Introduction to Research Purposes: We learned that research serves three main purposes: to explore, describe, and explain. These purposes help us to familiarise ourselves with a topic, describe our findings, and answer the question "why?".</li>
                                <li>Scientific Method: We delved into the history and application of the scientific method, which involves observation, hypothesis, reasoning, and testing. This method is a cornerstone of problem-solving in research.</li>
                                <li>Deductive and Inductive Reasoning: We examined the differences between deductive and inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning moves from an idea to an observation, while inductive reasoning moves from an observation to an idea.</li>
                                <li>Research Ethics: We explored the key principles of research ethics, including respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest. These principles ensure that research is conducted ethically, protecting the rights and wellbeing of participants.</li>

                                <li>Understanding the Purpose of Research: We comprehended the various reasons for conducting research and the significance of each purpose in both academic and professional settings.</li>
                                <li>Application of the Scientific Method: We learned how to apply the scientific method in our research, including the roles of observation, hypothesis, reasoning, and testing.</li>
                                <li>Distinguishing Between Reasoning Types: We differentiated between deductive and inductive reasoning and understood their applications in research.</li>
                                <li>Ethical Research Practices: We gained knowledge about the ethical considerations necessary for conducting research, particularly when it involves human participants. We learned to apply the principles of respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest in our research projects.</li>

                                <li>Understanding Complex Concepts: Grasping the nuances of deductive and inductive reasoning was initially challenging. It required careful study and application to different scenarios to fully understand these concepts.</li>
                                <li>Ethical Considerations: Navigating the ethical implications of research was complex. Ensuring that all ethical principles were adhered to while designing research required careful consideration and planning.</li>
                                <li>Balancing Theory and Practice: Integrating theoretical knowledge with practical applications of the scientific method and ethical research practices was challenging but ultimately rewarding.</li>
